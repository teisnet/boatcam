SOLVED
#7 Create Camera 'disabled' field to turn off camera queries.
#11 Create new websocket handler for newly created cameras
    Fix ONVIF connectivity bug for newly created cameras (client side). Connectivity is only established after server restart.
#12 New cameras with empty 'slug' field becomes unreachable. Validate new cameras before creation, slug field nonempty, english characters.
#17 Fix new Camera "null" ports issue: "Could not update camera 56d210adf89cc1480ce783ac (Cast to number failed for value "null" at path "onvif")"
    Fixed: Jade non-escaped use of variables
#19 Form pages still submit to server when required fields are empty
#20 Prevent slashes in slugs and berth numbers, as they don't work in urls
#9 Fix error at invalid onvif response: TypeError: Cannot read property 'panTilt' of undefined at ...\node_modules\onvif\lib\ptz.js:105:21
   Appears when onvif is set to a address/port that exists but is not ONVIF
