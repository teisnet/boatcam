#11 Create new websocket handler for newly created cameras

#19 Form pages still submit to server when required fields are empty
#20 Prevent slashes in slugs and berth numbers, as they don't work in urls
#9 Fix error at invalid onvif response: TypeError: Cannot read property 'panTilt' of undefined at ...\node_modules\onvif\lib\ptz.js:105:21
